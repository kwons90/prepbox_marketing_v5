This approach builds a solid foundation of basic math skills, instilling precision, discipline, and computational fluency in students.

This approach seeks to develop students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills by encouraging them to explore mathematical concepts deeply. By understanding the underlying principles and reasoning behind mathematical operations, students are better equipped to apply their knowledge to complex real-world situations. The focus on conceptual understanding fosters creativity, logical reasoning, and the ability to think flexibly, preparing students for higher-level mathematics and non-routine problem-solving.",
